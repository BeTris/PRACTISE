#binomial coefficient 
#def 1 : A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of x^k in the expansion of (1 + x)^n.
#def 2 : A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be
#chosen from among n objects more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of a n-element set. or nCr
